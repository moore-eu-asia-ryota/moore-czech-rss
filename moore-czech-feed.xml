    <title>Moore Advisory CZ: State Could Save Up to CZK 337 Million Annually by Adjusting Payments for Social Care Stays
</title>
    <description>A Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs analysis by Moore Advisory CZ suggests that adjusting payment terms for social care facilities could save the state budget up to 337 million crowns annually.  The study explored the possibility of increased client and family contributions for care in senior homes and facilities for people with disabilities.  While 52% of clients have someone who could contribute, current contribution rates are only 27%.

The analysis involved a survey of 1,000 clients and considered the financial capacity of both clients and their relatives to cover costs.  Proposed changes, similar to alimony laws, would require contributions from relatives, capped at 20% of their disposable income after living expenses.  The analysis includes safeguards for clients and relatives.

Currently, public funds cover the shortfall when client incomes are insufficient.  The proposed changes could significantly reduce this burden; however, increased administrative costs must be factored in.  Germany and Austria were used as models for incorporating private resources to fund social care.  The average monthly cost for basic care in October 2022 was nearly 14,500 crowns per client.

    <title>Staying Effective and Not Going Crazy: Moore Czech Republic Joins Global Workplace Stress Reduction Initiative
</title>
    <description>Moore Czech Republic, part of Moore Global, joined the Mindful Business Charter to prioritize employee well-being and reduce workplace stress.  High stress significantly impacts physical and mental health, relationships, and often leads to absenteeism.  A recent Ipsos study revealed that 60% of Czechs experienced significantly life-impacting stress last year, with over 25% taking days off due to stress;  39% of Gen Z individuals missed work due to this.

The Charter promotes initiatives such as improved meeting management, reduced emails, and respecting employees' downtime.  Moore Czech Republic already integrates these practices, further demonstrating their commitment.  The company offers workshops like "How to Stay Effective and Not Go Crazy," providing practical stress management and work-life balance tips.  They also encourage physical activity through initiatives such as the "Moore to the Moon" challenge and a local "WALKING CHALLENGE 10K," promoting employee health while supporting charitable causes.  These efforts underscore Moore's dedication to a healthier and more supportive work environment.
