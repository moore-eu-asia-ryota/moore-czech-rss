    <title>ANACOT CAPITAL Group Expands Again, Acquiring Blanenský Pistol Manufacturer Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia
</title>
    <category>ANACOT</category>
    <description>ANACOT CAPITAL, led by Pavel Drobil, and MaeG Investment SICAV, managed by Moore Czech Republic, acquired an 85% stake in Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia, a Czech-Slovakian manufacturer of premium target pistols, in December 2024.  Laugo Arms, known for its innovative Alien pistol featuring a unique gas-operated recoil system, has significant international growth potential.  J&T Banka financed the transaction.

The acquisition aims to leverage ANACOT CAPITAL's engineering expertise and MaeG Investment's network for international expansion and product development.  This includes launching an improved version of the Alien pistol.  Laugo Arms currently sells approximately 3,500 hand-made pistols annually, with over 40% of sales in the USA.  The company reported €8.2 million in revenue and €2.3 million in EBITDA in 2022, projecting over €12 million in revenue for 2023.  ANACOT CAPITAL, with a 2023 turnover of CZK 1.9 billion, plans to utilize its existing manufacturing capabilities to support Laugo Arms' growth.  Both parties see significant potential for market growth, both domestically and internationally, alongside further product development in collaboration with the former owner.

    <title>Staying Effective and Not Going Crazy: Moore Czech Republic Joins Global Initiative to Reduce Workplace Stress
</title>
    <category>Legal</category>
    <description>Moore Czech Republic, part of Moore Global, joined the Mindful Business Charter to prioritize employee well-being and reduce workplace stress.  High stress significantly impacts physical and mental health, relationships, and work attendance, as evidenced by a recent Ipsos study showing 60% of Czechs experiencing significantly life-impacting stress last year.  The Charter commits Moore to actions promoting well-being, such as efficient meeting planning, reduced emails, and respecting employees' downtime.

The company already implements these principles, offering courses like "How to Stay Effective and Not Go Crazy," providing practical stress management and work-life balance tips.  Initiatives like the "Moore to the Moon" challenge, encouraging physical activity to reach a collective distance equivalent to the moon, and the local "WALKING CHALLENGE 10K," further support employee health and contribute to charity.  These efforts demonstrate Moore's commitment to creating a healthier work environment and fostering a culture of open communication, respect, and mindful work practices.

    <title>Reskilling: An Elevator to Higher Professional and Salary Levels. Interest is Growing, Support is Not.
</title>
    <category>Legal</category>
    <description>Czech Republic's utilization of retraining courses lags behind the EU average, despite their crucial role in adapting to the evolving job market.  Only 8.3% of Czechs aged 25-74 participated in retraining courses in the four months prior to a 2023 prosperity index survey, compared to the EU average of 12.7%.  Increased employer support, particularly for specific age groups, could significantly improve participation.

While the number of participants rose by 39% year-on-year in the first half of 2023, reaching 20,118,  nearly half were in digitally focused programs funded by the National Recovery Plan. This reflects decreasing employer demand for low-skilled workers.  Those seeking retraining most often possess basic education, apprenticeships, or high school diplomas without vocational training.  Lifelong learning offers advantages for better job prospects, regardless of age or current profession.

Retraining isn't limited to formal courses;  mature students, including a cleaner pursuing a high school diploma to work with special needs children and a professional athlete obtaining a coaching license, highlight the transformative potential of further education.  Increasingly, institutions are integrating AI training into curricula, reflecting its growing importance.  Older workers (35-55+), comprising over half of retraining participants, possess valuable experience and loyalty, yet often need flexible work arrangements and technological support to fully engage in the modern job market.  Overcoming personal barriers like financial constraints, lack of employer or family support, and fear of new technologies is crucial for maximizing the benefits of retraining.

    <title>ESG Reporting Subject to New Rules: The CSRD Directive Will Shape Its Form from the New Year
</title>
    <category>Test, Test2</category>
    <description>The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandates stricter non-financial reporting, significantly altering how companies present their sustainability efforts.  It introduces standardized ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements, demanding credible and transparent information on environmental, social, and governance impacts. This aims to create consistent, comparable reports enabling investors and stakeholders to better evaluate companies' sustainability performance.  Effective ESG reporting should not only meet legal requirements but also offer business value and a competitive advantage.

Early preparation for CSRD's stringent requirements is crucial.  Vague ESG reports are no longer acceptable; sustainability reports will be subject to mandatory audits, with inconsistencies leading to reputational and legal issues.  Successful reporting relies on transparent data, requiring systems to monitor and analyze environmental, social, and governance impacts.  A crucial aspect is the double materiality analysis, assessing both the company's external impact and how external factors influence the company, identifying risks and opportunities. This ensures transparency, encompassing both successes and challenges.

CSRD aims to standardize ESG reports and prevent greenwashing.  ESG should be integrated into the overall business strategy, not treated as a side initiative.  All relevant teams must be involved, making ESG a company-wide commitment, fostering trust and strengthening relationships with stakeholders.  Beyond meeting CSRD's minimum requirements, companies should aim for leadership in sustainability, recognizing ESG's potential for long-term growth and competitiveness.  A gap analysis can identify areas needing improvement, guiding companies toward exceeding minimum standards.

    <title>NIS2: A largely unknown quantity.  Cybersecurity directive awareness is low.
</title>
    <category>NIS2</category>
    <description>The Czech Republic is implementing the NIS2 directive (Network and Information Systems Directive 2) through a new cybersecurity law, expanding on the 2014 law.  While this significantly impacts thousands of companies across various sectors, a Moore Czech Republic survey reveals low awareness.  Seventy-two percent of over 200 surveyed executives across sectors like telecommunications, healthcare, and finance were unfamiliar with NIS2.  The new law, expected to take effect next year with some phased implementation, requires registered entities to report to the National Cyber and Information Security Authority (NÚKIB), implement security measures, and report incidents.

Only 18% of respondents demonstrated a detailed understanding of the necessary steps.  The survey highlights significant obstacles to implementation, including insufficient funding (50%), lack of expertise (49%), and complex legal requirements (41%).  While some companies already implement certain measures like employee training and data backups, others lack incident response plans or NÚKIB reporting procedures. Despite limited awareness, those familiar with NIS2 largely view it positively, recognizing its potential to enhance customer trust and cybersecurity.  Moore Czech Republic, with experience in legal implementation, offers support and analysis for navigating these changes.

    <title>Companies Enter a New Era of Mandatory ESG Reporting: The CSRD Directive is the Reason
</title>
    <category>ESG</category>
    <description>The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) significantly alters ESG reporting for European businesses.  Expanding upon the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), CSRD mandates non-financial activity reporting for all large companies meeting at least two of three criteria: over 250 employees, €50 million turnover, or €25 million assets.  This affects approximately 250 Czech firms and over 50,000 across Europe by 2026.  Large companies under NFRD must report for fiscal year 2024, while others meeting the criteria must report from 2025, with reports due in 2026.  Listed SMEs have until 2026, with a possible two-year extension.

CSRD mandates reporting using European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), ensuring data consistency and comparability.  Independent verification of ESG data is also required, enhancing credibility.  The directive emphasizes "double materiality," considering both a company's impact on its environment and external factors' influence on the business.  This holistic approach provides a comprehensive ESG picture.  Implementing CSRD presents both challenges and opportunities.  While requiring investment in new systems and processes,  strong ESG performance reduces risks, improves access to capital, and fosters investor, customer, and employee trust.  Ultimately, CSRD marks a new era of mandatory ESG reporting, driving sustainable business practices and long-term success.

    <title>Economic analysis of Moore Czech Republic confirmed the profitability of the Ještěd cable car investment
</title>
    <category></category>
    <description>A feasibility study by Moore Czech Republic recommends a single-cabin, two-cable gondola lift (Funifor system) for the Liberec-Ještěd cable car replacement, extending the route to Horní Hanychov.  This option, chosen by city council and supported by a public poll, requires a 750 million CZK investment but offers the best long-term economic viability with a projected 15.5-year return.  Construction, beginning late 2026, aims for a January 2029 opening.  The extended route offers superior accessibility via public transport and parking, maximizing ridership and attracting more tourists, particularly with the potential addition of a mid-station for skiers.  The estimated average fare is 326 CZK, with discounted rates for Liberec residents.  The previous system, owned by České dráhy, was decommissioned following a 2021 accident and will be purchased by the city for 34.976 million CZK.

    <title>NIS2: The Great Unknown.  Cybersecurity Directive Awareness Remains Low.
</title>
    <category></category>
    <description>The Czech Republic's parliament is currently debating a new cybersecurity law implementing the EU's NIS2 directive.  While this significantly impacts thousands of Czech companies across various sectors, a Moore Czech Republic survey reveals low awareness.  Of over 200 senior executives surveyed, 72% hadn't heard of NIS2.  Even those familiar with it demonstrated limited understanding.  NIS2 mandates that regulated service providers register with the National Cyber and Information Security Authority (NÚKIB), implement security measures, and report cyber incidents.  Only 18% of respondents showed detailed understanding of the required actions.

The new law expands the scope from hundreds to approximately 10,000 entities, including energy producers, airlines, hospitals, and government bodies.  Preparing for compliance necessitates audits, process updates, and new technologies. The survey highlighted significant obstacles: 50% cited insufficient funds, 49% lacked expertise, and 41% found the legislation complex.  While some respondents viewed NIS2 positively, seeing it as beneficial for customer trust and cybersecurity improvements, many lack a comprehensive implementation plan.  Although some basic cybersecurity measures are already in place in many companies (employee training, data backups), incident response plans and reporting to NÚKIB remain uncommon.
