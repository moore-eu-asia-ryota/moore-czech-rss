    <title>ANACOT CAPITAL Group Expands Again, Acquiring Blanenský Pistol Manufacturer Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia
</title>
    <category></category>
    <description>ANACOT CAPITAL, led by Pavel Drobil, and MaeG Investment SICAV, managed by Moore Czech Republic, acquired an 85% stake in Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia, a Czech-Slovakian manufacturer of premium target pistols, in December 2024.  Laugo Arms, known for its innovative Alien pistol featuring a unique gas-operated recoil system, has significant international growth potential.  J&T Banka financed the transaction.

The acquisition aims to leverage ANACOT CAPITAL's engineering expertise and MaeG Investment's network for international expansion and product development.  This includes launching an improved version of the Alien pistol.  Laugo Arms currently sells approximately 3,500 hand-made pistols annually, with over 40% of sales in the USA.  The company reported €8.2 million in revenue and €2.3 million in EBITDA in 2022, projecting over €12 million in revenue for 2023.  ANACOT CAPITAL, with a 2023 turnover of CZK 1.9 billion, plans to utilize its existing manufacturing capabilities to support Laugo Arms' growth.  Both parties see significant potential for market growth, both domestically and internationally, alongside further product development in collaboration with the former owner.

    <title>Staying Effective and Not Going Crazy: Moore Czech Republic Joins Global Initiative to Reduce Workplace Stress
</title>
    <category></category>
    <description>Moore Czech Republic, part of Moore Global, joined the Mindful Business Charter to prioritize employee well-being and reduce workplace stress.  High stress significantly impacts physical and mental health, relationships, and work attendance, as evidenced by a recent Ipsos study showing 60% of Czechs experiencing significantly life-impacting stress last year.  The Charter commits Moore to actions promoting well-being, such as efficient meeting planning, reduced emails, and respecting employees' downtime.

The company already implements these principles, offering courses like "How to Stay Effective and Not Go Crazy," providing practical stress management and work-life balance tips.  Initiatives like the "Moore to the Moon" challenge, encouraging physical activity to reach a collective distance equivalent to the moon, and the local "WALKING CHALLENGE 10K," further support employee health and contribute to charity.  These efforts demonstrate Moore's commitment to creating a healthier work environment and fostering a culture of open communication, respect, and mindful work practices.

    <title>Reskilling: An Elevator to Higher Professional and Salary Levels. Interest is Growing, Support is Not.
</title>
    <category></category>
    <description>Czech Republic's utilization of retraining courses lags behind the EU average, despite their crucial role in adapting to the evolving job market.  Only 8.3% of Czechs aged 25-74 participated in retraining courses in the four months prior to a 2023 prosperity index survey, compared to the EU average of 12.7%.  Increased employer support, particularly for specific age groups, could significantly improve participation.

While the number of participants rose by 39% year-on-year in the first half of 2023, reaching 20,118,  nearly half were in digitally focused programs funded by the National Recovery Plan. This reflects decreasing employer demand for low-skilled workers.  Those seeking retraining most often possess basic education, apprenticeships, or high school diplomas without vocational training.  Lifelong learning offers advantages for better job prospects, regardless of age or current profession.

Retraining isn't limited to formal courses;  mature students, including a cleaner pursuing a high school diploma to work with special needs children and a professional athlete obtaining a coaching license, highlight the transformative potential of further education.  Increasingly, institutions are integrating AI training into curricula, reflecting its growing importance.  Older workers (35-55+), comprising over half of retraining participants, possess valuable experience and loyalty, yet often need flexible work arrangements and technological support to fully engage in the modern job market.  Overcoming personal barriers like financial constraints, lack of employer or family support, and fear of new technologies is crucial for maximizing the benefits of retraining.
